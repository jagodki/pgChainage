description=plugin for chainage linestrings of a table directly in PostgreSQL/PostGIS
version=1.0
author=Christoph Jung
email=jagodki.cj@gmail.com

about=This plugin converts a layer of line strings into a chain of points. The main work takes place directly in the PostgreSQL-/PostGIS-database, i.e. big tables have not to be imported into QGIS before and during processing.
      _____
      Usage: Just insert the parameters for the connection to your database, than choose the schema and table (note: all available schemata and tables will be displayed), fill in the names of the ID- and geom-column, choose a CRS for the resulting point layer (a metric-CRS is recommended) and fill in an equidistance (if you choosed a metric-CRS, this values is in meters) - and start the processing. A new schema called "chainage" will be created and in this schema the chainaged layer will be stored. The new layer will be named like "name_of_linestring_layer"_chainage. If a table with the same name already exists, the plugin will throw an exception. The plugin will also throw an exception, if the user inserts names for the id- and/or geom-column, that do not exists in the database.
      _____
      Important: The plugin has been developed and tested using PostgreSQL 10 and PostGIS 2.4. Maybe it will not work with older versions of the named products, e.g. the chainage is realized by using the PostGIS-function ST_LineInterpolatePoint, which has the name ST_line_interpolate_point e.g. in PostGIS 2.1.
